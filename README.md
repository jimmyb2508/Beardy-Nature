# Project
This is a portfolio design I created for my friend Chris Smith who is a wildlife photographer.

# Method
For this project I used HTML & CSS

# Potential Improvements
1. I'm conscious page re-loads with high resolution images could impact on speed. This could be a potential improvement further down the line.
2. The images are copyrighted but this won't stop people from accessing them. There could be an opportunity to store them on the backend and charge for them.
3. Chris does sell merchandise - and whilst this is mentioned on the page - there could be a shop.
